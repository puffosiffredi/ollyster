WEB-BASED IRC client, with a Social Flavour.

My challenge here was to proof something I realized time ago: a "social network" 
is just a web interface to a program which allows people to message each others.

If I am right, it is possible to make a social network out of every protocol which
allows users to message each others. Ostatus is an example, and this is why GnuSocial 
exists. 

Movim is the name of a social network built on top of Xmpp (Jabber).

I think we can have social-like clients for mail or NNTP protocol also, but I choose IRC,
since it is robust, widely used, I repeat **very** used (who says "IRC is dead" is just a stupid, 
go and check instead of lecturing your ignorance! ).

I will use the messaging protocol as a backbone, and the CTCP extension to add social-like
behaviors.

So:

    Phase 1: Web IRC client (Plan IRC).
    Phase 2: Wev IRC client + CTCP (Social features, like icons and so).
